    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<P> My name is <strong>TIJANI SAHEEDD BABATOMIWA</strong>. I am a native of Irepo local government OYO STATE.I was born and brought up in ABULE- EGBA Lagos State.  I was born into the family of Mr and Mrs TIJANI RASAK on the 27TH OF MARCH 2002. I am a student who’s studying Computer Science in Kwara State Univeristy Malete, Kwara State. I live in a Lagos with my family, I have two siblings,an elder sister and a younger sister. This made my parent pamper me and shower me with love even my siblings get jealous at times. My Dad is an advertising practioner and works at ROSABEL GROUP OF COMPANY while my mum is a lecturer at the LAGOS STATE UNIVERSITY.  <br>
        
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <P> I started my Schooling when i was a year and a half. I started from creche in the year 2003 then resumed preschool in the same year. I got into nursery school during the year 2004 and finished nursery school during the year 2005 and was promoted into the primary school in a school called ROSE VALLEY SCHOOLS which is located at OKO-OBA AGEGE, LAGOS STATE. It's not too far from where we reside, but i still ride the school bus to school with my siblings. I used four years in primary school because i wrote my common entrance examination at primary 4. I proceed to my secondary educational level at the same school because the school has a very high standard in education. I wrote junior waec in Jss3 then I passed and proceeded to the Senior Secondary school. I was a science student who wants to become a software developer in the future. When i wrote my Waec and Neco exams i passed with flying colors then i did my Jamb examination i scored 267. I got the post utme form for Kwara state univeristy after the application i waas admitted not quite long I was given  the course ui applied for, Computer Science as. This made me happy and able to pursue my dreams of becoming on of the best software dedvelopers in history. <br>
        
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<P> I am a very calm-headed, noble, gentle, kind, obedience, and a peace maker so as what i was taught from home so i have to put all this into practice. I am reliable and accurate in all my doings so to be patriotic to the nation and serve as a good leader to others so as to behave well in the society to maintain peace and orderliness <br>
        
       &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <P> I dont really have that much hobbies but the most i love doing is writing codes as practicals for what i learn in an online class called W3SCHOOLS.  I have always wanted to be a Web designer.I fell in love with designing website, but over the years, my passion for designing a website has increased. Over the past few months, I have started living this dream and im trying to improve more on it<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <p> According to my parents, the only way to achieve all your goals is to work very hard and never give up on them. They have never imposed themselves and demanded that any of their children become what they want us to become  rather they want us to follow our dreams. 
        
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Things I want to learn: There are many things I have to learn and want to learn. The first thing that I want to learn is cooking. The number of things I can make in the kitchen is limited. One of the dishes i want to learn correctly is vegetables. It’s a soup that I have started loving, and knowing how to cook african dishes in the kitchen will make me happy.
      Two more things that I want also to learn are snow-boarding and how to drive a tractor, because my grandpa owns a farm snd has a tractor. I love doing adventurous things because they make give a feeling of thrill. <br>
    
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<P> I aquired some skills on the computer like Web design, Graphics design, making use of the software, photography   <br>
      Thank you for reading about me, i know you've known much about me  now, even i already know more lol.
